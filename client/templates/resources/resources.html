    <p>1st - 11th January 2015
        <br />The Palm Springs Film Society organises two festivals every year, the well-known ShortFest and the Feature edition in January. Well followed in North America, the festival regroups mostly the best festival circuit films of the previous year, with a programme of films that generally lean towards the end of their travel, and reaching out to Oscar nominees. This year welcomes the screenings of Athlete, Son of Babylon and Another Year.

    <p>22nd January - 1st February 2015
        <br />Known until 1991 as the Utah/US Film Festival, Sundance is the leading festival for discovering directorial newcomers. Despite freezing temperatures, huge queues and phenomenally expensive accreditation and hotel costs, it attracts a huge number of buyers, particularly those interested in American indies, and was behind the launch of films like ‘Sex Lies and Videotapes’ and ‘The Blair Witch Project’. Sundance is discussing documentary London screenings at the O2 Centre in the fall. Ralph Fiennes has just confirmed Coriolanus’s screening at the festival (ahead of Berlin), as well as a return for Azazel Jacobs, Kevin Smith and Miguel Arteta and the much-anticipated The Troll Hunter.

        <br />Set up by Robert DeNiro to reinvigorate the TriBeCa area, Tribeca Film Festival has now become one of the most watched (and best funded) festivals in the US offering a mix of independent and mainstream US premieres. Recently Tribeca has been involved (and a naming partner) of Qatar’s £3bn investment funding into arts through the Doha Tribeca Film Festival, as well as supporting documentary filmmakers through the Gucci Tribeca Documentary Fund.

    <p>23rd April - 7th May 2015
        <br />America’s oldest film festival is also one of the most risk-taking. Its huge programme blends both mainstream festival circuit hits as well as out-of-the-blue indies, which has set SFIFF a bande-apart from other city based festivals. Though closely watched by industry, its main audience comes from a huge local and loyal following.

    <p>23rd April - 3rd May 2015
        <br />The world’s most important documentary festival, Hot Docs in Toronto screens the who’s who of the documentary releases of the year. Hot Docs has kept clear from steering into the television realm, which has kept it leaps ahead of its closest rivals IDFA and Leipzig. Its huge international delegation, conference and market makes this the Cannes of the documentary world.

        <br />Udine’s young festival dedicates itself entirely to far eastern cinema, with strands focusing on different countries but also retrospectives.</p>
    <p>The festival is worth attending for programmers looking at expanding their oriental slate, but tends to showcase somewhat predictable and festival circuit films.

    <p>2nd - 7th June 2015
        <br />The unlikely home for the world’s largest showcase of Japanese cinema, Nippon Connection, has reached a comfortable position in its 10year history. Their large programme selection means the festival is generally seen more as a film market than a film festival, making it a must of film buyers from around the world. Its delegate centre sets up in the JWG University, and for 4 days hosts one of the most informal and down to earth festival focuses.

    <p>13th - 24th May 2015
        <br />The king of festivals, Cannes is the most important date in filmmakers’ calendar. Attracting hundreds of parties, glamour, yachts and celebrities, it also runs in parallel with a number of other festivals all serving under the same banner. Expect champagne, tuxedos, lots of business cards, business and lots of bullshit. The festival includes the Cannes Short Film Corner and Producers Network alongside the below strands.

Hosting 6000odd screenings in two weeks, it is run specifically to sell films and spreads across the Palais des Festivals and the hotels and small cinemas spreading out across Cannes. In recent years Cannes’ market has consulted on the creation of satellites in Latin America.

        <br />One of the many North American film festivals to follow a recent trend in purchasing its own cinema, the festival has the unfortunate of overlapping Cannes though defending its timing as an audience festival rather than an industry event. That said the festival attracts a stellar number of northern American premieres and an extremely wide and diverse range in programming. If I weren’t in Cannes, I’d be here.

        <br />Sydney Film Festival’s an interesting addition to this list. On one hand it celebrates Australian/New-Zealand productions – the only category eligible to submit, whilst all other international features are screened by invitation only – which has resulted in a fairly predictable programme of festival circuit films, often duplicated off the big player festivals. Whilst considerably older than Melbourne or Adelaide, SFF has been trailing behind though its domestic films still seem to keep it in the limelight.

        <br />The youngest addition to the list, Transylvania’s small town festival has managed to reach some stature amongst the eastern European block both with its mix of glamour and informality. 2010’s programme included a number of Far East titles that barely screened this side of the Rhine, as well as some of the best Eastern European films of the year. Definitely worth following.

Though the festival isn’t exactly known for discovering new films, the festival did get somewhat of a facelift in 2006 when it replaced almost all senior staff and highlights a significant number of Far East horrors to cater the Western market.

    <p><span style="font-size: small;"> Good luck budgeting this one; the Auckland International Film Festival and Wellington Film Festival are now merged as the New Zealand International Film Festival, and since boast a further 13 city runs. Its main outfit is the Auckland stretch over 3 weeks in July, whilst the remaining film prints will stretch as far across until mid November. In most part a best of fests festival, its programming team is split between Paris and Wellington, and the festival offers the rare opportunity to catch even mainstream foreign/art-house films in a country which sees relatively few released.</span>

    <p>One of the largest gatherings for the fantastic and horror genres, Montreal’s Fantastic Festival hosts one of the most important number of north American film buyers every July. Initially focusing on only Hong Kong and Japanese cinema, the festival has become international and a worth-while stop, least because of the sheer number of films screening under one umbrella.

    <p>30th July - 16th August 2015
        <br />Australia’s highlight festival, MIFF is as much known for stirring controversy as for launching homegrown talent. In 2010 the world premiere of Bruce LaBruce’s L.A. Zombie was banned by the conservative Australian censors, and the screening of Son of Babylon caused a hissy for director Richard Moore, who demanded payment when the producer decided to pull it from the programme. In that same time the festival came under the funders microscope with its review, setting up two senior positions: an internal promotion for the senior programme, whilst the director left for Brisbane. The festival screens a large number of festival circuit ‘best of fests’ complemented by a fantastic homegrown strand. Its market, the MIFF South Market, brings together an important number of Asian and EU based companies, and is partnerered with London’s Production Finance Market.

    <p>2nd - 12th September 2015
        <br />Venice Film Festival is the world’s first and most exclusive film festivals. Specializing in world premieres, the festival has been ruled under the tight regime of Marco Müller since 2004, a time in which the festival has witnessed one of its most turbulent times since its incepting years. With the setting up of the Rome Film Festival in 2006, the Venezia has undergone some change, halted its development of the new cinema, and responded to the funding cuts by selling premiere tickets to the ubber rich – which has resulted in a festival even more difficult to attend (as a professional) and, sadly, increasingly catering for the Nikki Beach members (across from the Palace on the Lido) than its core audiences.

        <br />Now in its 37th year, Telluride Film Festival has established a sort of North American cinephile frenzy. Announcing its lineup barely 24hrs before its launch each year, the festival launches some of the year’s competing box office mainstream films (in 2010 Venice opener Black Swan, Danny Boyle’s 127hrs and Stephen Frears’ cringeworthy Tamara Drew). Though maybe not the best places for film buyers, the festival is an important publicity generating exercise for both EU and US based distributors, and has been described as one of the funnest festivals in America.

Particularly since the early '90's Toronto has become an equally important festival to Cannes, running screenings in over 300 venues. Both its festival screenings and market screenings have proved equally as important a launching ground for films, and Toronto has become one of the few unmissable film festivals in world.

In 2010 its 73year-old founder Kim Dong-ho stepped down, news which was received with many questions about succession and who could match accomplishments reached over the last 15years: a funding budget of over $5million, one of the world’s few major film markets, and changing the face of the industrial port town of Pusan (Busan) as a hub for the arts. With the announcement of the construction of a new arts centre in the vibe of the TIFF Lightbox, the Dureraum. The festival emphasizes both an art house and commercial programme, and is stringent on filmmaker attendance – supported by generous hospitality offers for participating films.

Despite some protests, Rome Film Festival soon emerged as one of Europe’s most talked about festivals, with an immediate ability to discover new indie and art house releases (in part Venice turned obsessed with Hollywood blockbusters) thanks to its requirements of a European premiere, which caused grumbles from a few other leading EU festivals.

The 2010 festival launched with The King’s Speech, and included a slate of films screened just about everywhere else before it. That said its Arab film slate was of some interest.The festival runs in parrallel to Dubai Film Market.
